                  p Artem is great! His code is solid and his client relations are the best! He understands requirements quickly, asks questions upfront, and then works. Never a risk of waking up halfway around the world and seeing the wrong work completed in the morning. I definitely recommend him for your Rails project!

                  p Artem is super talented!  Artem was hired a few months ago to create the back end code on Ruby for a very complicated app.  His responsiveness to any issue or problem that arose was amazing, he worked incredibly well with our three other programmers in three different countries, and his ability to design code to address the most complex application challenges was real genius.
